  "content": "<p>Albert Jr., Dr. Johnston’s son, revealed his family’s story to movie producer Louis de Rochemont a few years after he learned the truth from his parents. De Rochemont used the story as the inspiration for <em>Lost Boundaries</em>. The film depicts prominent white stars Mel Ferrer and Beatrice Pearson in the leading roles without the presence of any African Americans. This fact shows that even in a story about a family who was black, Hollywood producers still felt it was necessary to have an exclusively white cast. Dr. Johnston’s story and the film <em>Lost Boundaries</em> are examples of the strain that passing puts on family relationships and the measures African Americans who passed for white took to ensure their identities remained a secret.</p>"

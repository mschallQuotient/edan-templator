Many black actors and actresses, whether they wanted to be or not, were subjected to skin appearance alterations, including blackface. Blackface is the use of makeup to exaggerate skin tone and facial features used in the entertainment industry to present a stereotypical and racist image. In <em>The Song of Freedom</em>, a movie starring Paul Robeson, the use of blackface darkens the castâ€™s skin tones throughout the film, including Robeson himself. The goal of these films was to portray African Americans as uncivilized, savage&nbsp;and comical beings.</p>"
